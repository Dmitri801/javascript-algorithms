## Big O Notation

### What is Big O Notation

- Big O is a system or way of generalizing code and comparing it to other peices of code that accomplish the same result.
- Big O lets us assign generalized labels to the performance of our code.

### Why does it matter?

- Performance MATTERS
- There is a best algorithm or best solution
- Its always helpful to understand how code compares
- Useful for discussing different trade-offs between different approaches
- Identifying parts of code that is inefficient can help us find pain points in our applications
- it comes up in interviews A LOT

### The problem with time

- Different machines will record different times
- The same machine will record different times
- For fast algorithms , speed measurements may not be precise enough

### If not time than what?

- Rather than counting seconds which are variable, lets count the number of `simple` operations the computer has to perform.

### Offical definition

- Big O is a way to formalize fuzzy counting
- It allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input grows
